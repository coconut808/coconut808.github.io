Chances are you've stubmled across my site because...
1. We work together or have worked together.
2. Coded projects together.
3. I applied for a role and listed this URL as my personal page.
4. I took a class and shared this github account or website.
5. Randomly found it.

### Always learning
At some point, or another, I've listed these classes on my resume. My resume has evolved over time and I try to keep it concise. So why not here.  These are actual classes I've taken. By that, I mean I've had to sit in a classroom at least once a week.  The tech or versions can give you an idea about timelines. I'm not current in all the things. (ie. Do you know who SUN is? It used to be a large company. )

## Fun tidbit 
I studied Japanese (日本語) for 5 years.  I've passed the first 2 JLPT proficiency exams, started studying for the 3rd but that is on the back burner.

* "When presented with a complex problem you will drill down to get all the nitty gritty details to see the true issue at hand."
* "You're always doing something."
