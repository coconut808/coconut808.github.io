Chances are you've stubmled across my site because...
1. We work together or have worked together.
2. Coded projects together.
3. I applied for a role and listed this URL as my personal page.
4. I took a class and shared this github account or website.
5. Randomly found it.

### Always learning
At some point, or another, I've listed these classes on my resume. My resume has evolved over time and keep it concise. These are actual classes I've taken. By that, I mean I've had to sit in a classroom at least once a week.  The tech or versions can give you an idea about timelines. I'm not current in all the things. ie. Do you know who SUN is? It used to be a large company.
