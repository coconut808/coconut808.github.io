I've updated this site for potential employers, co-workers, and the like.  

Some current things I'm working on is a personal blog site witten with NextJS.  I've heard good things about supabase so I'm learning that too.  

I'm currently attending a ML/AI Class.  The kids have gotten us into Roblox.  Yea, can you believe it? But! They have a pretty extensive API and perhaps I can collect some data for my class. For that class I've picked up a couple books, to supplement some of the course material.  The first one I want to mention is Effective Pandas 2 by Matt Harrison.  I'm not enrolled in any affiliate programs yet or I'd post a link to Amazon or something.  Here's the link from Matt's store however: [https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book)
